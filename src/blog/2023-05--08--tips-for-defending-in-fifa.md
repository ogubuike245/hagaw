If you're playing FIFA, you know that defense is a critical component of the game. Without a solid defense, it's difficult to win games and advance to higher levels. Here are some tips to help you improve your defensive skills and become a better FIFA player:

1. **Stay patient and don't rush in**: One common mistake is to rush in when trying to tackle an opponent. Instead, stay patient and wait for the right moment to make a move. This will prevent you from committing unnecessary fouls and give you a better chance to win the ball.
2. **Use the "contain" button**: Pressing the "contain" button (usually the X button on Xbox and Square on PlayStation) will make your player track the opponent and try to contain them without committing a tackle. This is useful when you're trying to prevent the opponent from making a pass or moving into a dangerous area.
3. **Use the right stick to jockey**: Jockeying is an effective technique for defending in FIFA. Use the right stick (or R3 button) to jockey and move your player in front of the opponent. This will make it harder for them to dribble past you and create scoring opportunities.
4. **Use the slide tackle sparingly**: While slide tackles can be effective, they're also risky. A mistimed slide tackle can result in a foul or a yellow card. Use slide tackles sparingly and only when you're sure you can win the ball cleanly.
5. **Use team press and offside trap**: If you're struggling to defend against a strong opponent, try using the team press and offside trap tactics. The team press will put pressure on the opponent's players and force them to make mistakes, while the offside trap will catch them offside and give you a chance to win the ball.

By following these tips and practicing your defensive skills, you can become a better FIFA player and win more games. Remember to stay patient, use the right techniques, and stay focused on the game. Good luck!
